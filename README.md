# health_database
-----------------
Just a personal project. I'm trying to keep track of what I eat and how it affects me. 
I have a form thing a nutritionist gave me, but filling out papers all the time is annoying, and I needed to learn some database stuff anyways, so I just made a database interface that logs all the info I need. 
In the future I may look into doing som data analysis stuff with it. Maybe some graphs or something. We'll see.
