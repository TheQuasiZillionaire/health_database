# health_database
-----------------
Just a personal project. I'm trying to keep track of what I eat and how it affects me. 
I have a form thing a nutritionist gave me, but filling out papers all the time is annoying, and I needed to learn some database stuff anyways, so I just made a database interface that logs all the info I need. 
In the future I may look into doing som data analysis stuff with it. Maybe some graphs or something. We'll see. 

For now, I just made the interface entirely mobile-centric, so I can input an entry while I'm walking places. I'll eventually add some media-query CSS to make it more desktop-friendly, but for now it's functional, and that's pretty much all I need.
